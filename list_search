# List_search v0.1 - Russ Brown
# This program goes thru a list of 100k numbers, picks one at random, removes it from the list and keeps trying.
# I was interested in how many guesses and how long it would take to get the full 100k with the random generator
# future changes might include inputing the range and being able to adjust all variables based on that number
